# Fasta-Region-Inspector

## Introduction
Fasta-Region-Inspector (**FRI**) is a bioinformatics tool for analyzing somatic hypermutation (SHM).

## Purpose
Analyzing cancer cohorts for SHM is a interesting cancer-genomics related research question, and one that is computationally intensive.  SHM occurs when immunoglobulin genes accumulate apparently random point mutations within productively rearranged V, D, and J segments, as defined by [Elaine S. Jaffe MD, in Hematopathology, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/somatic-hypermutation).  More specifically, [Blood. 2009 Apr 16; 113(16): 3706–3715](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670789/) states that the hallmark of SHM is the increased percentage of mutations in hypermutable RGYW motifs.  Correctly identifying SHM in large cancer genomics datasets can be a complex and tedious computational problem. 

This bioinformatics tool gives researchers the ability to answer the following questions:
- Which variants are within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) of the corresponding gene?
- Where do user-defined mapped ambiguity strings lie within 2 kb of the TSS?
- Amalgamating the previous 2 questions, which variant(s) are found within a mapped ambiguity string, that also lie within 2 kb of the TSS?

## Improvements from Previous Implemenation

### Overview
This tool aims to answer common SHM variant-level questions in a software package that provides:
- Excellent runtime performance in a robust, functional implementation.
- Minimized memory usage.
- A simple, YAML input file format.
- Clean, informative stdout logging.

### Old vs. New
This version of **FRI** is vastly improved upon from the [old version](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD) in numerous ways, including:
- Migration from single script to [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) project
  - Stack is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects.
  - It creates completely reproducible and robust development environments.
  - This makes ongoing maintenance, updates, bugfixes, any and all changes to the codebase a breeze.
- A completely re-worked internal memory representation of user-defined FASTA data using [compact regions](http://ezyang.com/papers/ezyang15-cnf.pdf).
  - The old implementation loaded the FASTA file in a strict ByteString, and then parsed it into an appropriate data structure using the [elynx-seq](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/elynx-seq) library.
  - There's nothing inherently wrong with the approach, but it doesn't scale well with sequencing data as this type of data is typically very large.  That means the garbarge collector (GC) has to walk through this in-memory structure many times for all the functions that operate on this data.
    - These functions include:
      - [ambiguityCodesWithinRegionCheck](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L381)
      - [ambiguityCodesWithinRegionCheckSmall](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L396)
      - [subStrLocations](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L458)
      - [subStrLocationsSmallForward](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L487)
      - [subStrLocationsSmallReverse](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L471)
      - [grabFastaSequence](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L508)
      - [smallGrabFastaSequence](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L514)
  - Previously, the [old version](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD) consumed memory in such a way that (using a concatenated amalgamation of all GRCh38 homo_sapiens genome assembly chromosome-level fastas) during a typical run that you would be required to have access to and run the software with at least 40+ GB of memory.
  - This same run now only requires about as much memory as ~2X the size of the FASTA file.
  - The minimized memory requirement is based on the usage of [compact regions](http://ezyang.com/papers/ezyang15-cnf.pdf).
    - [compact regions](http://ezyang.com/papers/ezyang15-cnf.pdf) serve two purposes (per [Data.Compact](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/compact-0.2.0.0/docs/Data-Compact.html) documentation):
      - Data stored in a Compact has no garbage collection overhead. The garbage collector considers the whole Compact to be alive if there is a reference to any object within it.
      - A Compact can be serialized, stored, and deserialized again. The serialized data can only be deserialized by the exact binary that created it, but it can be stored indefinitely before deserialization.
- A new, YAML input file format.
  - The new [YAML](https://yaml.org/) input file format replaces the [custom command-line argument string](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD/blob/master/src/fri.hs#L840) required to run the [old version](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector-OLD) with a simple key-value format:
    - ```
      Variants:
        - Sample: 'SMP1'
          HGNC_Symbol: 'AFF3'
          Chromosome: 'chr2'
          Start_Position: '100007433'
          End_Position: '100007433'
          Reference_Allele: 'G'
          Alternate_Allele: 'A'
          ENST: 'ENST00000409579'
        - Sample: 'SMP2'
        ...
      ```
  - The rest of the command-line arguments are replaced with appropriate compact nested mappings (see [Example 2.12 Compact Nested Mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-2-language-overview))
  - This also supports a more legible, reproducible methodology since you have an easy to read and run file format.
- Switching from the [Copying Collector GC](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/commentary/rts/storage/gc/copying) to the new [Non-Moving GC](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/papers/gamari2020alligatordemo.pdf)
  - [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) is the the de-facto compiler for the Haskell programming language.
  - GHC initially had only one implementation of GC, namely the Copy Collector GC.
    - This form of GC has a stop-the-world approach, which causes the program to pause as the memory usage raises to a level where de-allocation is necessary.
  - GHC now has a new implemenation of the GC, the Non-Moving GC, which this program utilizes **by default**.
    - The [new implemenation](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/commit/7f72b540288bbdb32a6750dd64b9d366501ed10c) of GC has a concurrent mark & sweep garbage collector to manage the old generation. The concurrent nature of this collector typically results in significantly reduced maximum and mean pause times in applications with large working sets.
      - For more details, please see the following [presentation](https://bgamari.github.io/media/2018-11-18-nonmoving-gc-for-ghc.pdf).
  - You can switch between the two forms of GC using the GHC command-line argument ```-with-rtsopts=-xn```.
- Dramatic runtime performance improvement
  - After all of the above changes (moving to stack or the new YAML input file doesn't affect runtime performance, but the rest of the points do), there is ~160X speedup in runtime (*benchmarks up-coming*) in the examples run locally so far (comparable tests are showing ~8 hrs down to ~3 minutes).
  - In general, the more ambiguity codes and variants there are to be analyzed by **FRI**, the larger the runtime disparity between the old and new version.

### Conclusion
Don't use the old version!

## Configuration YAML

**FRI** utilizes a configuration YAML file to provide the necessary components for a successful run.

The following keys are **required**:
- ```Fasta``` -> The filepath to the FASTA file. (String)
- ```Variants``` -> A [compact nested mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-2-language-overview) (see [below](https://github.com/Matthew-Mosior/Fasta-Region-Inspector/blob/main/README.md#variant-type) for more information).
- ```Ambiguity_Codes``` -> An array of ambiguity codes to search against. (String)
- ```Output_Directory``` -> The filepath to the output directory (must already exist). (String)
- ```Keep_BioMart``` -> Whether or not to keep the BioMart file from the wget system call. (Boolean)
- ```Ignore_Strandedness``` -> Whether or not to ignore strandness of the respective gene and search the TSS in both directions. (Boolean)
- ```Write_Ambiguity_Codes``` -> Whether or not to write CSV file containing all locations of user-defined mapped ambiguity code strings in TSS window. (Boolean)

The following keys are **optional**:
- ```TSS_Window_Size``` -> The TSS window size to search across. (String)

## Variant Type
The ```Variant``` [compact nested mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-2-language-overview) represents the required information surrounding a variant-of-interest to be examined by **FRI**.

The following keys are **required**:
- ```Sample``` -> The associated sample identifier for the respective variant (String).
- ```HGNC_Symbol``` -> The HGNC symbol for the respective variant (String).
- ```Chromosome``` -> The chromosome the respective variant lies within (String).
- ```Start_Position``` -> The start position for the respective variant (String).
- ```End_Position``` -> The end position for the respective variant (String).
- ```Reference_Allele``` -> The reference allele for the respective variant (String).
- ```Alternate_Allele``` -> The alternate allele for the respective variant (String).
- ```ENST``` -> The ENST for the respective variant (String).

### Note
The above data can typically be easily grepped/programmed for from the output of a bioinformatics pipeline run, such as the [alignment_exome.cwl](https://github.com/genome/analysis-workflows/blob/master/definitions/pipelines/alignment_exome.cwl).

You can also start from a [VEP](https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html)-annotated variant file, which can typically be created once you have run an aligner/variant caller (see above).  Starting from a VEP-annotated file will allow you to filter the variants on gene so that you can better target your analysis with this tool.

## Building the project
This software was developed on an M1 mac.

It has not been tested on other operating systems or chipsets, but should run perfectly fine on stack-supported Operating Systems, including:
- Windows
- MacOS
- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Fedora
- Arch Linux
- CentOS
- Red Hat
- Amazon Linux
- openSUSE
- NixOS
- Generic Linux


If you are on an M1 mac, please build the project using the following:
```
% stack build --arch aarch64
```

If you are **NOT** on an M1 mac, please build the project using the following:
```
% stack build
```

## Example Usage
**FRI** is easy to use, as it only requires a single command-line positional argument, the configuration YAML.

If you are on an M1 mac, please run the project using the following:
```
% stack exec --arch aarch64 fasta-region-inspector-exe /path/to/configuration.yaml
```

If you are **NOT** an M1 mac, please run the project using the following:
```
% stack exec fasta-region-inspector-exe /path/to/configuration.yaml
```

## Output
**By default**, **FRI** outputs a single CSV file,namely *variants_in_ambiguity_codes.csv*, containing all of the information needed to answer the questions posed at the top of this README.

Each user-defined variant will be included in this CSV file, with the following fields:
- ```Variant```
- ```Region```
- ```Variant_Within_Region```
- ```Ambiguity_Code```
- ```Mapped_Nucleotide_String```
- ```Ambiguity_Code_String_Locations_Within_TSS```

Depending on how you set the ```Write_Ambiguity_Codes``` key in the configuration YAML, you can also get an additional CSV file containing all locations of user-defined mapped ambiguity code strings in the TSS window.

## Interpreting the Output
Interpretation of the *variants_in_ambiguity_codes.csv* file is a simple process.

Let's use an example to illustrate this:

|Variant|Region|Variant_Within_Region|Ambiguity_Code|Mapped_Nucleotide_String|Ambiguity_Code_String_Locations_Within_TSS|
|-------|------|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|SMP1:H1-5:chr6:27867219:27867219:G:A:ENST00000331442|6:27867588:&#x200B;-1:H1-5|Y|GYW|GCT|27867220|

## Example Stdout (logging)
The following is a real stdout (log) of a **FRI** run:
