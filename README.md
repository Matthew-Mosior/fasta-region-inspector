# Fasta-Region-Inspector

## Introduction
Fasta-Region-Inspector (FRI) is a bioinformatics tool for analyzing somatic hypermutation (SHM).

## Purpose
Analyzing cancer cohorts for SHM is a interesting cancer-genomics related research question, and one that is computationally intensive.  SHM occurs when immunoglobulin genes accumulate apparently random point mutations within productively rearranged V, D, and J segments, as defined by [Elaine S. Jaffe MD, in Hematopathology, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/somatic-hypermutation).  More specifically, [Blood. 2009 Apr 16; 113(16): 3706–3715](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670789/) states that the hallmark of SHM is the increased percentage of mutations in hypermutable RGYW (underlined residue is the most frequently mutated) motifs.  Correctly identifying SHM in large cancer genomics datasets can be a complex and tedious computational problem. 

This bioinformatics tool gives researchers the ability to answer the following questions:
- Which variants are within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) of the corresponding gene?
- Where do user-defined mapped ambiguity strings lie within 2 kb of the TSS?
- Amalgamating the previous 2 questions, which variant(s) are found within a mapped ambiguity string, that also lie within 2 kb of the TSS?

This tool aims to answer common SHM variant-level questions in software package that provides:
- Excellent runtime performance in a robust, functional implementation.
- Minimized memory usage.
- A simple, YAML input file format.
