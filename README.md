# Fasta-Region-Inspector

## Introduction
Fasta-Region-Inspector (FRI) is a bioinformatics tool for analyzing somatic hypermutation (SHM).

## Purpose
Analyzing cancer cohorts for SHM is a interesting cancer-genomics related research question, and one that is computationally intensive.  SHM occurs when immunoglobulin genes accumulate apparently random point mutations within productively rearranged V, D, and J segments, as defined by [Elaine S. Jaffe MD, in Hematopathology, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/somatic-hypermutation).  More specifically, [Blood. 2009 Apr 16; 113(16): 3706â€“3715](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2670789/) states that the hallmark of SHM is the increased percentage of mutations in hypermutable RGYW (underlined residue is the most frequently mutated) motifs.  Correctly identifying SHM in large cancer genomics datasets can be a complex and tedious computational problem. 

This bioinformatics tool gives researchers the ability to shed light on:
